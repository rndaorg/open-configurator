I'll analyze the current project structure and features to suggest the next 10 prompts that would significantly extend and enhance this product configurator application. Let me first examine the current state of the project to understand what's already implemented.

Based on my analysis of the current Open Configurator project, I can see it's a sophisticated product configurator with advanced features like rule engines, 3D visualization, AI recommendations, and multi-page navigation. Here are the **next 10 prompts** that would significantly extend this project:

## Next 10 Extension Prompts

### 1. **User Authentication & Account Management**
```
"Add Supabase authentication with user registration, login, logout, and profile management. Include features like saved configurations, order history, and personalized recommendations based on user behavior. Add protected routes and user-specific data."
```

### 2. **Shopping Cart & Checkout System**
```
"Implement a complete shopping cart system with add to cart functionality, cart management, quantity updates, and a multi-step checkout process. Include order summary, shipping options, and integration with payment processing."
```

### 3. **Admin Dashboard & Content Management**
```
"Create a comprehensive admin dashboard for managing products, categories, configuration options, pricing rules, and viewing analytics. Include features for bulk operations, content management, and system configuration."
```

### 4. **Multi-language & Internationalization**
```
"Add internationalization (i18n) support with multiple language options, currency conversion, and region-specific content. Include RTL language support and localized number/date formatting."
```

### 5. **Advanced Search & Filtering System**
```
"Implement a powerful search system with filters, faceted search, autocomplete, and advanced filtering options. Include search analytics, popular searches, and intelligent search suggestions."
```

### 6. **Notification System & Real-time Updates**
```
"Add a comprehensive notification system with email notifications, in-app notifications, push notifications, and real-time updates using Supabase real-time subscriptions for inventory changes and order updates."
```

### 7. **Mobile App with React Native**
```
"Create a React Native mobile application that shares the same backend with the web app. Include mobile-specific features like camera integration for AR visualization, push notifications, and offline mode."
```

### 8. **Advanced Reporting & Business Intelligence**
```
"Build a comprehensive reporting system with sales analytics, conversion funnels, A/B testing results, customer insights, and exportable reports. Include interactive charts and scheduled report generation."
```

### 9. **API & Third-party Integrations**
```
"Create a REST API with comprehensive documentation and implement integrations with popular services like Stripe for payments, SendGrid for emails, external inventory systems, CRM platforms, and social media sharing."
```

### 10. **Enterprise Features & Multi-tenancy**
```
"Transform the application into a multi-tenant SaaS platform where different businesses can have their own configurators. Include tenant management, custom branding, role-based permissions, and enterprise-grade security features."
```

## Why These Extensions Matter

Each of these prompts addresses a specific business need and would add significant value:

- **Prompts 1-3** focus on core e-commerce functionality that's essential for any commercial application
- **Prompts 4-6** enhance user experience and operational efficiency  
- **Prompts 7-8** expand platform reach and provide business insights
- **Prompts 9-10** enable scalability and enterprise adoption

These extensions would transform the current product configurator from a demo/prototype into a production-ready, enterprise-grade SaaS platform capable of serving multiple businesses across different industries.

The next logical development phase should focus on core e-commerce functionality first (authentication, cart, admin), then expand to enhanced UX features (i18n, search, notifications), followed by platform expansion (mobile, analytics, APIs), and finally enterprise capabilities (multi-tenancy, advanced security). This progression ensures a solid foundation before adding advanced features.

I'd like to implement one of these suggested features - which one should we start with?
